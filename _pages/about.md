<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student at TML Lab, University of Sydney, Australia, supervised by [Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). 

I graduated from College of Computer Science, Chongqing University with a bachelor’s degree in 2022, advised by [Prof. Lei Feng](https://lfeng-ntu.github.io) and [Prof. Yantao Lee](http://www.cs.cqu.edu.cn/info/1497/5749.htm). I won the 12th China Youth Science and Technology Innovation Award (less than 50 candidates in Chinese undergraduate and post-graduate students each 2 years) and the Chongqing University May·4th Youth Medal (Award one undergraduate student of Chongqing University in academic research per year).

My research interest includes learning with imperfect data and bionics.
