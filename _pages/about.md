## About me

I am a final-year PhD candidate at [Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/ubtech-sydney-artificial-intelligence-centre.html), [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), advised by Prof. [Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). I am also receiving valuable advice from Prof. [Lei Feng](https://lfeng1995.github.io). I regularly serve as a reviewer for ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, UAI, AISTATS, ACM MM, TPAMI, TIP, MLJ, TMLR, JAIR. 

Currently, I am visiting Singapore. I am now visiting [AI-for-X Centre](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/ai-x) at College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg)) and collaborating with Prof. [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). Prior to this, I served as a Research Officer at Agency for Science, Technology and Research Centre for Frontier AI Research ([A*STAR CFAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar)) and collaborating with Prof. [Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang) and Dr. [Xingrui Yu](https://xingruiyu.github.io).

At present, most of my works are dedicated to promoting machine learning models that can effectively and efficiently generalize on large-scale, imperfect data, breaking through data bottlenecks. I welcome collaboration opportunities across all areas. **I am actively exploring postdoctoral research opportunities.**
