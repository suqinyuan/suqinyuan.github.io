## About me

I am a final-year PhD candidate at [Sydney Artificial Intelligence Centre](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/data-science-and-computer-engineering/ubtech-sydney-artificial-intelligence-centre.html), [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), advised by Prof. [Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io). I am also receiving valuable advice from Prof. [Lei Feng](https://lfeng1995.github.io). I regularly serve as a reviewer for ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, TPAMI, and others. 

Currently, I am visiting Singapore, serving as a Research Officer at [A*STAR CFAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar) and collaborating with Prof. [Ivor Tsang](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang) and Dr. [Xingrui Yu](https://xingruiyu.github.io).

My primary focus has been on “Overfitting in Modern Deep Learning”. At present, most of my works are dedicated to promoting machine learning models that can effectively and efficiently generalize on large-scale, imperfect data, breaking through data bottlenecks. I welcome collaboration opportunities across all areas. I am actively exploring postdoctoral research opportunities.
